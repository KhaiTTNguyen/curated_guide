Some issues with fMRI:
* **spatial specificity** of BOLD is limited because the vessels form large networks where an increase in the size of vessels at one location will also cause changes in downstream vessels. So even the smallest vessels can change their size in response to the activity of faraway neurons (7). The spatial specificity of optical imaging of blood vessels is superior to that of fMRI.
* **temporal specificity** of fMRI is perhaps a more pressing limitation. Although hemodynamic fluctuations can be fast (~1 s), this is still too slow to follow neuron activation during cognitive processes such as perception and decision making (~0.1)
