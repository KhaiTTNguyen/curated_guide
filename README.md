# curated_guide
This repo hosts all the learning resources that I used in course work and past projects

* [C.md](https://github.com/KhaiTTNguyen/curated_guide/blob/master/C.md)
* [python.md](https://github.com/KhaiTTNguyen/curated_guide/blob/master/python.md)
* [cu.md](https://github.com/KhaiTTNguyen/curated_guide/blob/master/cu.md)

Now and then, you don't want to run stuff on your weak laptop, try remote development on clusters from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
