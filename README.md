This repo hosts all the learning resources that I used in course work and past projects

Now and then, you don't want to run stuff on your weak laptop, try remote development on clusters from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). 
 ### About me
I am an aspiring medical scientist with an interest in neuro-degenerative white-matter diseases including neuroimmuno-mediated inflammatory disease: Multiple Sclerosis, Neuromyelitis Optica (Devic's disease), and Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM). 
With the imaging method developed, the far reaching goal of my research is to assist with therapeutic efforts for patients experiencing neuro-immunological diseases.

 ### Why do I work on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging?

 ### Advantages of diffusion MRI
 Histology is the gold standard for evaluating pathology induced from white matter diseases. However, histologic evaluation is not ethically justified in human. This is where the advantage of MRI noninvasive neuroimaging shines.
